# Earthquake Buffer Viewer

A lightweight web-based GIS application built using the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript (v4.31)](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) 
that loads recent earthquake data from a live GeoJSON feed, displays it on an interactive map, 
and allows users to perform a 5 km buffer operation with dynamic symbology and legend.
